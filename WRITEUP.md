### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.


|              | Virtual Machines                                                                                                                                                               | App Service                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Costs        | - Higher upfront and ongoing costs due to VM provisioning, storage, and maintenance. <br>- You pay for the compute power and storage whether or not the VM is actively being used. | Cost-efficient with pay-as-you-go pricing. No need to maintain idle compute resources, and scaling is more cost-effective for most scenarios.                                  |
| Scalability  | Scaling requires manual intervention, such as resizing the VM or adding additional resources. It’s more effort-intensive and less flexible for dynamic workloads.              | Auto-scaling is built-in, which allows dynamic allocation of resources based on app demand without additional configuration.                                                   |
| Availability | High availability requires extra configuration, such as setting up Availability Sets, Zones, or load balancers. It doesn’t come built-in.                                      | High availability is included out of the box. There’s no need to configure additional infrastructure for reliability.                                                          |
| Workflow     | Complex setup. Requires manual installation and configuration of Flask, Python, and other necessary software. This process can be time-consuming and prone to errors.          | Simplified workflow with native support for Python and Flask applications. Deployment can be done directly via Git, Docker, or CI/CD pipelines, which streamlines the process. |


### Justification
Azure App Service is the ideal choice for deploying the CMS app due to its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and comprehensive feature set tailored for web applications. It provides seamless deployment options with native support for Python and Flask, eliminating the need for complex setup and configuration. Built-in auto-scaling ensures the app can dynamically handle varying traffic loads without manual intervention, making it both efficient and budget-friendly. High availability is included by default, ensuring reliability without requiring additional infrastructure. Furthermore, App Service offers integrated features like SSL, monitoring, and managed identity, allowing developers to focus on the application itself rather than managing underlying servers. These advantages make it a superior choice over Virtual Machines for projects that prioritize ease of use, scalability, and cost optimization.



### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

The decision to use Azure App Service could change if the CMS app's requirements evolve significantly. For instance, if the app needs custom software or system-level configurations that App Service cannot support, a Virtual Machine would be more appropriate. Similarly, if the application includes background tasks, high-performance computing, or non-web-based functionalities, a VM offers greater flexibility. Regulatory or compliance requirements that demand fine-grained control over infrastructure and networking would also necessitate a switch to a VM. Additionally, if the workload becomes highly predictable and computationally heavy, a VM could provide cost benefits through reserved pricing. To suit the application requirements, several adjustments may need to be made. If the CMS app requires extensive background processing, tasks like job queues or scheduled tasks may need to be added, potentially requiring tools like Celery or Azure Functions. Additionally, if the app demands extensive database transactions, optimizing database queries or switching to a managed database service (e.g., Azure SQL Database) might be necessary. For advanced security needs, integrating with Azure Key Vault for secrets management and implementing role-based access control (RBAC) could become essential. If compliance or regulatory standards are required, incorporating features like custom networking, specific encryption protocols, and logging frameworks aligned with those standards would also need to be considered.
